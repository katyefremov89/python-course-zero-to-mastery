# break - to break condition
# continue - continue without performing the condition
# pass - is useful for coding - if we are writing code and we dont want to use a specific code block then pass will be used
# Example:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
for item in my_list:
    # still thinking about it
    pass

i = 0
while i < len(my_list):
    print(my_list[i])
    i += 1
